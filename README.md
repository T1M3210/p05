## Description
Our project is a recreation of Project 0 (the storytelling website), designed to be more interactive and “fun.” The registration page mimics The Password Game, requiring users to complete a minigame to create a valid password. After logging in, users will navigate the site and encounter obstacles while progressing through different storytelling pages. Upon navigating through the website, the user will receive a reward.
